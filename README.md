# JiraIssueConsolePy (scaffold)

This repository is a Python port of the C# project `Jaegerfeld/JiraIssueConsole`.

Current status: scaffold created (minimal CLI, jira_client stub, core logic, basic tests).

Next steps: follow the TDD/BDD roadmap in `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to port behaviors
from the original C# project.
